        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>⅓ cup brown sugar</li>      
            <li>1 tablespoon minced ginger</li>   
            <li> ½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>           
            <li> 2 pounds flank steak</li>                       
            <li>   1 (10 ounce) package dried Japanese udon noodles</li>          
            <li>   6 ounces snow peas</li>          
            <li>    1 cup broccoli florets</li>             
            <li> 1 tablespoon mirin (Japanese sweet wine)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk soy sauce, vegetable oil, brown sugar, ginger, and garlic powder together in a large bowl. Pierce flank steak several times with a large fork. Place in the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let marinate in the refrigerator, at least 4 hours and up to overnight.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook udon noodles in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 13 to 14 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over high heat. Remove steak from marinade and cook until well-browned, about 2 minutes per side. Reserve marinade.</li>
            <li>Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Grill steak, basting with half of the reserved marinade, until internal temperature reaches 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) for medium or 150 degrees F (65 degrees C) for medium-well, at least 10 minutes per side. Slice steak thinly against the grain.</li>
            <li>Combine remaining marinade, snow peas, broccoli florets, and mirin in the skillet. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until snow peas are tender, about 2 minutes. Add drained noodles; mix well to combine.</li>
            <li>Divide noodle mixture among large bowls. Top with steak slices.</li>
        
        </ol>
